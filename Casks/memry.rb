  app "MemryNote.app"

  # Three naming eras coexist. Today app.name is package.json "name"
  # (@memry/desktop) — electron-builder never writes productName into the asar —
  # so live app state (Chromium profile, crdt-store, models, config) sits under
  # @memry/, logs under Logs/@memry, and electron-updater's cache under
  # @memrydesktop-updater (name with "/" sanitized). The memrynote entries cover
  # the runtime identity rename (PR #897) that moves userData/logs/updater cache
  # there; @memry* entries stay for not-yet-migrated installs. The App Support/
  # MemryNote entry is aspirational but harmless — kept. Bundle-id
  # (com.memrynote.memry) keys Caches/HTTPStorages/Preferences/ShipIt and is
  # rename-independent.
  # Vault content (notes + .memry/*.db) lives under the user-chosen vault dir
  # (default ~/Documents/Memry) and is deliberately NOT zapped.
